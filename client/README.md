##Project Planning
I started out by figuring out how the user would interact with the website. The first page is where the user either logs in or signs up. From there they are taken to the home page. Then they have the option to either select the search, trades or favorties page from the nav bar. After I had that figured out, I decided to work on planning what information I needed to save to the database. Lastly, I had to make sure my API could produce all of the information I needed. The API wasnt the easiest to use but after a lot of work, I was able to get the information to render on the page. 

##Project Coding
During this phase I started building the backend routes and a skeleton structure of the site. I was able to make sure the routes were working by utilizing Postman. The bare bones skeleton of the website was set and then I moved on to the logic of our website. I decided to use ReactRouter for frontend navigation and used React Hooks. While working on this part of the project, I had some slight hiccups with getting data to save, edit and delete. This was due to a token error and having protected routes. Once I was able to ping the API, save data and delete, I was finally at MVP. Whats next? I have quite a few things on my wishlist and also would like to learn and utilize other dependencies. Lastly, I would like to spend some time on CSS and produce a visual masterpiece.
